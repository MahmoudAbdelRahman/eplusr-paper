  abstract = {Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from writing computer programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer, and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. Literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic in an ordinary human language, much like the text of an essay, in which macros are included to hide abstractions and traditional source code.
Literate programming (LP) tools are used to obtain two representations from a literate source file: one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the "tangled" code, and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be "woven" from the literate source. While the first generation of literate programming tools were computer language-specific, the later ones are language-agnostic and exist above the programming languages.},

  abstract = {Modern commercial buildings' resource consumption is metered at various levels of spatial and temporal resolution to track and reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. However, not all data that could be used to detect faults or identify efficiency improvements are available due to the cost of meters and inaccessibility of the data they produce. In the field of building operation, building performance simulation (BPS) can help in quantifying unmeasured energy flows, for instance solar gains, heat loss from infiltration, etc. Furthermore, integrating building information modeling (BIM) in building operation and maintenance can decrease operation risk and costs, as well as maintain facility management quality. However, in practice there is a lack of efficient utilization of this application by building operators. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework to estimate and visualize energy flows and the associated cost. The framework consists of 1) developing a BIM model, 2) converting the BIM model to a BPS model, 3) calibrating the model, and 4) visualizing energy and cost flows using Sankey diagrams. The study demonstrates this framework on a real-world case study, and hence provides a comprehensive energy use assessment on the building level to facilitate the decision-making by building operators. Finally, the results of a survey that was deployed to a sample user group to assess the usability and effectiveness of the proposed Sankey diagrams are provided.},

Coloured Petri-nets are used in specification and check on the behaviour of these interfaces before their implementation. The EnergyPlus input data definition (IDD) file is provided as an example to illustrate the process of generating an executable interface prototype which can be used for scenario validation, and can be evolved towards the target interface tool.

  abstract = {Steadily increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in all phases of building's lifecycle, together with more attention for openBIM and growing software support for the most recent version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC 4) have created a very promising context for an even broader application of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). At the same time, an urgent need for modeling guidelines and standardization becomes evident. A well-defined BIM-based workflow and a set of tools that fully exploit and extend the possibilities of the openBIM-technology can make the difference when it comes to reliability and cost of BEPS to design, build and operate high-performance buildings. This paper describes the essential elements of this integrated workflow, explains why openBIM comprises much more than just a standardized file-format and what is achieved with the already available technology, namely the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and a newly developed Model View Definition. This MVD is tailored to the needs of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) that uses the Modelica language together with a specific library (IDEAS) and can easily be adapted to other libraries. In this project, several tools have been developed to closely integrate BEPS and IFC4. The simulation engine now gets the vast majority of the required input directly from the IFC4-file. For the implementation of the tools, the PYTHON language and the open source library IfcOpenShell are used. A case study is presented, that was used for extensive tests of the proposed approach and the implemented tools. The essential benefits of this new workflow are illustrated, and the feasibility is demonstrated. Opportunities and remaining bottlenecks are identified to encourage further development of BIM software to fully support IFC4 as an information source for BEPS. Besides some improvements of the proprietary class structure and functionality, enabling the export of IFC4 files based on custom MVDs is one required key feature.},

This paper presents energy-oriented software tool that both accommodates the Egyptian context and provides informative support that aims to facilitate decision making of zero energy buildings. A residential benchmark was established coupling sensitivity analysis modelling and energy simulation software (EnergyPlus) as a means of developing a decision support tool to allow designers to rapidly and flexibly assess the thermal comfort and energy performance of early design alternatives. Validation of the results generated by the tool and ability to support the decision making are presented in the context of a case study and usability testing.},

The paper reviews current trends in simulation-based building performance optimization (BPO) and outlines major criteria for optimization tools selection and evaluation.

The review is carried out by means of a literature review of 165 publications and interviews with 28 optimization experts. The findings are based on an inter-group comparison between experts. The aim is to assess the gaps and needs for integrating BPO tools in NZEB design. The findings indicate a breakthrough in using evolutionary algorithms in solving highly constrained envelope, HVAC and renewable optimization problems. Simple genetic algorithm solved many design and operation problems and allowed measuring the improvement in the optimality of a solution against a base case. Evolutionary algorithms are also easily adapted to enable them to solve a particular optimization problem more effectively. However, existing limitations including model uncertainty, computation time, difficulty of use and steep learning curve.

  abstract = {Past design analysis integration efforts have addressed the need to achieve seamless data integration between design and analysis software applications. These efforts have been dominated by an interoperability focus. Recently, it has been recognized that these solutions suffer from several limitations. For one, they assume a `perfect world' in which all information is structured and all mappings between design and analysis representations exist on a generic level. Secondly, most interoperability solutions have a data focus, whereas true design analysis integration requires a ``language'' to express both analysis requests and the answers that are generated by experts responding to these requests. An intrinsic part of this language is the logic of the design analysis process. Hence, the integration effort requires a strong process rather than data focus. The Design Analysis Integration (DAI)-Initiative aims to steer towards new solutions for design analysis integration that may overcome the limitations of current data-centric interoperability approaches. This paper reports on the first phase of the development, which has produced a first-generation `workbench' prototype for managing a process driven design analysis dialogue. The workbench is meant to enable a more robust use of existing building models such as IFC for the mapping to simulation tools. The paper presents the underlying theories, prototype development, and findings from the research and concludes with a discussion of future work, targeting extension and benchmarking of the current prototype.},

Modular coordination (MC) and parametric design both have great potentials in reducing waste at the design stage. And anecdotal evidence suggests that great volumes of waste can be reduced through integration of parametric design into MC. The issue of proposing workflows in this context, however, is under-researched, and practical applications, if any, are at the rhetorical stage. To accomplish this, an integration attempt is made in this study to provide the details of a developed-and-experimented workflow for this purpose; a generative algorithm is developed through the Rhinoceros 3D\textendash Grasshopper platform, subject to MC rules. Two sets of horizontal and vertical modules are obtained from a prototype model, while an evolutionary solver function is applied in reducing the generated construction waste volume. According to a pre-defined standard specification, different modular design variants that fully conform to the design constraints in modules array are developed, providing an operational workflow in construction waste reduction at the design stage. Introducing this workflow, and how the proposed workflow reduces the volume of post-optimization paneling waste by 2\% at its minimum are the major findings here. The insights derived from this study, would promote the interest of both the construction practitioners and researchers; the practicality of integrating parametric design into MC is proven.},

  abstract = {Much interest has been recently devoted to generative processes in design. Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process. In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine. The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings.},

It combines different constraints under a common framework to facilitate the definition of temporal relations between different tasks and provides a user-friendly web interface, which facilitates the planning of construction sites. Even though the framework uses complex mathematical models, the users do not need to know the underlying theoretical framework. Another important feature of the framework is, in contrast to usual static planning, that solutions can be dynamically adapted to take into account delays happening during the actual construction process. In order to show the applicability of the methodology, the paperspaper shows how a real construction project can be planned by using the framework.},

The results show that it is possible to automatically calculate the flexibility of buildings during the design process phases.

  abstract = {The global stock of buildings account for more than 40\% of global energy consumption. Improving their energy behaviour thus offers tremendous potential for promoting sustainable development. While new buildings can be benefited from new construction methods and techniques for ensuring a sustainable operation, a sustainable operation of existing buildings is only possible by retrofitting. However, the later represent the larger portion of the total stock, so effective retrofitting is fundamental for global improvement of energy efficiency. This article develops a methodological framework for predicting (i) the energy consumed in heating and cooling an existing commercial or institutional building, and (ii) the potential impact of different energy conservation measures that could be implemented on a given building. The proposed tool incorporates a simulation model and an algorithm strategy for parameter optimization. The framework is implemented in the JAVA programming language and evaluated in a case study of a 500 [m2] institutional building located in Puerto Montt, Chile. The results of this implementation show that the tool is competitive with the state-of-the art commercial simulation tool DesignBuilder. More importantly, it successfully estimated the savings obtained from different combinations of energy conservation measures for the building and proved to be computationally efficient, the algorithm requiring only 2.5 h to complete the simulation.},

In an attempt to mitigate climate change, the design of more sustainable buildings is advocated by the UK government. Furthermore, standalone design methods are being replaced with the concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The adoption of BIM has been documented to result in many benefits, which range from time to cost savings. During the initial planning stages, building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC schema lacks an energy domain, and as a result, an extension is proposed in this paper. This contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). The extended schema was developed by way of an externally coupled Java tool, which facilitates the transfer of data, and informs the building design decision-making process. The process of geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies, which are based on certified Passivhaus buildings in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales. The amount of error is acceptable, and it is mostly due to differences in the initial BIM model setup, not due to the processing of IFC files.},

Cloud and Web 3D technologies were utilized to develop a BIM data center that can handle the big data of massive BIMs using multiple servers in a distributed manner and can be accessed by multiple users to concurrently submit and view BIMs online in 3D. Traditional BIM include only static information such as the geometric parameters, physical properties, and spatial relations for modeling a physical space. In this study, BIM was extended to dynamic BIM, which includes dynamic data such as historical records from the monitoring of the facility environment and usage. Owing to this extension, a dynamic BIM became a parametric model, which can be used to simulate user behaviors. On the client side, this study applied WebGL in the web interface development to achieve the display of BIMs in 3D on browsers. Users can access the services via various online devices anytime and anywhere to view the 3D model online. On the server side, this study used Apache Hadoop, which can utilize multiple servers to provide mass storage spaces in a distributed manner with Bigtable-like structured storage, to establish the BIM data center. A schema for storing the big data of massive dynamic BIMs in Bigtables was proposed. MapReduce, a Hadoop component for the parallel processing of large data sets, was utilized to process big data from dynamic BIMs. A big data analysis framework to effectively retrieve and calculate required information from dynamic BIMs in the data center for various applications by MapReduce distributed computing was proposed this study. We provide principle and architecture of the proposed framework along with its experimental assessment. The results confirmed that scalable and reliable management of massive BIMs can be achieved using the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Buildings in cities consume 30\textendash 70\% of total primary energy, and improving building energy efficiency is one of the key strategies towards sustainable urbanization. Urban building energy models (UBEM) can support city managers to evaluate and prioritize energy conservation measures (ECMs) for investment and the design of incentive and rebate programs. This paper presents the retrofit analysis feature of City Building Energy Saver (CityBES) to automatically generate and simulate UBEM using EnergyPlus based on cities' building datasets and user-selected ECMs. CityBES is a new open web-based tool to support city-scale building energy efficiency strategic plans and programs. The technical details of using CityBES for UBEM generation and simulation are introduced, including the workflow, key assumptions, and major databases. Also presented is a case study that analyzes the potential retrofit energy use and energy cost savings of five individual ECMs and two measure packages for 940 office and retail buildings in six city districts in northeast San Francisco, United States. The results show that: (1) all five measures together can save 23\textendash 38\% of site energy per building; (2) replacing lighting with light-emitting diode lamps and adding air economizers to existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are most cost-effective with an average payback of 2.0 and 4.3years, respectively; and (3) it is not economical to upgrade HVAC systems or replace windows in San Francisco due to the city's mild climate and minimal cooling and heating loads. The CityBES retrofit analysis feature does not require users to have deep knowledge of building systems or technologies for the generation and simulation of building energy models, which helps overcome major technical barriers for city managers and their consultants to adopt UBEM.},

Development of a city-scale dataset of the existing building stock is a critical step of UBEM to automatically generate energy models of urban buildings and simulate their performance. This study introduces data needs, data standards, and data sources to develop city building datasets for UBEM. First, a literature review of data needs for UBEM was conducted. Then, the capabilities of the current data standards for city building datasets were reviewed. Moreover, the existing public data sources from several pioneer cites were studied to evaluate whether they are adequate to support UBEM. The results show that most cities have adequate public data to support UBEM; however, the data are represented in different formats without standardization, and there is a lack of common keys to make the data mapping easier. Finally, a case study is presented to integrate the diverse data sources from multiple city departments of San Francisco. The data mapping process is introduced and discussed. It is recommended to use the unique building identifiers as the common keys in the data sources to simplify the data mapping process. The integration methods and workflow are applied to other U.S. cities for developing the city-scale datasets of their existing building stock, including San Jose, Los Angeles, and Boston.},

Although BIM has the potential to increase work efficiency in the assessment process, low interoperability between BIM data and energy simulation models raises huge barriers to reliable BIM-based EPAs. This research aims to improve the interoperability of BIM-based EPAs by developing an environment that contains a process, a materials library, and an EPA support system that connects BIM and energy modeling.

However, its application has been limited to calibration using monthly aggregated data because it is computationally inefficient when the dataset is large. This study focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by: (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with Gelman\textendash Rubin statistics R\textasciicircum{} within 1{$\pm$}0.1.

Retrofitting existing buildings is a means toward reducing their energy footprint. Currently, building owners have several retrofit choices. Building energy simulations can be used to assist in this retrofit selection process, providing energy savings estimates from different retrofits. Currently available simulators, however, are not retrofit-oriented and are not built to enable comparisons among retrofits. In order to perform these comparisons, users are required to manually create building models for each retrofit, which is obviously a cumbersome process. In this paper, we introduce ROBESim, a retrofit-oriented building energy simulator. ROBESim is based on the popular EnergyPlus framework, and relies on EnergyPlus for most of the supported computations. By using the retrofit modules in ROBESim, the user can quickly and easily generate building models to perform retrofit comparison simulations. ROBESim was designed to be modular and extensible. We outline these modules and show how developers can build upon our work in ROBESim. In addition, we describe the retrofit module development process and discuss additional ease-of-use enhancements that make building energy simulation possible for users of all experience levels.},

This article reviews literature on this `performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice.},

We propose a heuristic algorithm to do load balancing in distribution networks affected by service restoration activities. Balancing is achieved through the use of utility directed usage of battery energy storage systems (BESS). This is achieved through demand response (DR) type signals that the utility communicates to individual buildings. We report simulation results on two test cases constructed with a 9-bus distribution network and a 57-bus distribution network, respectively. We apply the proposed balancing heuristic and show how energy storage systems can be used for temporary relief of impacted networks.},

  abstract = {Building Automation System (BAS) plays an important role in building operation nowadays. A huge amount of building operational data is stored in BAS; however, the data can seldom be effectively utilized due to the lack of powerful tools for analyzing the large data. Data mining (DM) is a promising technology for discovering knowledge hidden in large data. This paper presents a generic framework for knowledge discovery in massive BAS data using DM techniques. The framework is specifically designed considering the low quality and complexity of BAS data, the diversity of advanced DM techniques, as well as the integration of knowledge discovered by DM techniques and domain knowledge in the building field. The framework mainly consists of four phases, i.e., data exploration, data partitioning, knowledge discovery, and post-mining. The framework is applied to analyze the BAS data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is adopted to identify the most significant time variables to the aggregated power consumption. Then the clustering analysis is used to identify the typical operation patterns in terms of power consumption. Eight operation patterns have been identified and therefore the entire BAS data are partitioned into eight subsets. The quantitative association rule mining (QARM) method is adopted for knowledge discovery in each subset considering most of BAS data are numeric type. To enhance the efficiency of the post-mining phase, two indices are proposed for fast and conveniently identifying and utilizing potentially interesting rules discovered by QARM. The knowledge discovered is successfully used for understanding the building operating behaviors, identifying non-typical operating conditions and detecting faulty conditions.},

Exergoeconomic analysis and optimisation is a common practice in sectors such as the power generation and chemical processes, aiding engineers to obtain more energy-efficient and cost-effective energy systems designs. ExRET-Opt, a retrofit-oriented modular-based dynamic simulation framework has been developed by embedding a comprehensive exergy/exergoeconomic calculation method into a typical open-source building energy simulation tool (EnergyPlus). The aim of this paper is to show the decomposition of ExRET-Opt by presenting modules, submodules and subroutines used for the framework's development as well as verify the outputs with existing research data. In addition, the possibility to perform multi-objective optimisation analysis based on genetic-algorithms combined with multi-criteria decision making methods was included within the simulation framework. This addition could potentiate BER design teams to perform quick exergy/exergoeconomic optimisation, in order to find opportunities for thermodynamic improvements along the building's active and passive energy systems. The enhanced simulation framework is tested using a primary school building as a case study. Results demonstrate that the proposed simulation framework provide users with thermodynamic efficient and cost-effective designs, even under tight thermodynamic and economic constraints, suggesting its use in everyday BER practice.},

The research presents a new design simulation methodology based on incorporating a prototype tool (H.D.S. Beagle) that combines parametric modeling with multi-objective optimization through an integrated platform for enabling rapid iteration and trade-off analysis across the domains of design, energy use intensity, and finance. The research evaluates how the proposed method impacts design simulation processes, by either enabling and/or disrupting the early stages of design decision making. This simulation technology is presented through two major experiment sets: (1) a series of hypothetical cases emulating the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) design modeling and simulation process using our integrated simulation framework and technology; and (2) a pedagogically based experiment used for establishing benchmarks. Through these experiment data sets, both quantitative and qualitative data are collected, including human designer and computational analysis speeds, quantity of generated design alternatives, and quality of resulting solution space as defined by the evaluation metric of this research. The affordances for incorporation of real world design complexity into our computational design prototype and simulation methodology are discussed through both the enabling and the disruptive impact on the early stages of the design process.},

This paper describes the structure, as well as the rationale that led to this structure, of an ontology that captures the real-world concepts of a district energy system, such as a district heating and cooling system. This ontology (called ee-district ontology) is intended to support knowledge provision that can play the role of an intermediate layer between high-level energy management software applications and local monitoring and control software components. In order to achieve that goal, the authors propose to encapsulate queries to the ontology in a scalable web service, which will facilitate the development of interfaces for third-party applications. Considering the size of the ee-district ontology once populated with data from a specific district case study, this could prove to be a repetitive and time-consuming task for the software developer. This paper therefore assesses the feasibility of ontology-driven automation of web service development that is to be a core element in the deployment of heterogeneous district-wide energy management software.},

The obFMU can be used via co-simulation with all building simulation programs that implement the FMI, thus users are not limited to a particular tool. Another advantage is the use of obXML schema to represent occupant behavior, standardize the description of occupant behavior enabling information exchange.},

Reducing energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions in the buildings sector through energy conservation and efficiency improvements constitutes a key strategy for achieving global energy and environmental goals. Building performance simulation has been increasingly used as a tool for designing, operating and retrofitting buildings to save energy and utility costs. However, opportunities remain for researchers, software developers, practitioners and policymakers to maximize the value of building performance simulation in the design and operation of low energy buildings and communities that leverage interdisciplinary approaches to integrate humans, buildings, and the power grid at a large scale. This paper presents ten challenges that highlight some of the most important issues in building performance simulation, covering the full building life cycle and a wide range of modeling scales. The formulation and discussion of each challenge aims to provide insights into the state-of-the-art and future research opportunities for each topic, and to inspire new questions from young researchers in this field.},

A major challenge in simulation tools is how to deal with difficulties through large variety of parameters and complexity of factors such as non-linearity, discreteness, and uncertainty. The purpose of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can be described as identifying uncertainties in input and output of a system or simulation tool [1], [2], [3]. In practice uncertainty and sensitivity analysis have many additional benefits including: (1) With the help of parameter screening it enables the simplification of a model [4]. (2) It allows the analysis of the robustness of a model [5]. (3) It makes aware of unexpected sensitivities that may lead to errors and/or wrong specifications (quality assurance) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. (4) By changing the input of the parameters and showing the effect on the outcome of a model, it provides a ``what-if analysis'' (decision support). [11]. In this paper a case study is performed based on an office building with respect to various building performance parameters. Uncertainty analysis (UA) is carried out and implications for the results considering energy consumption and thermal comfort are demonstrated and elaborated. The added value and usefulness of the integration of UA in BPS is shown.},

SEOUL is applied on selected case study projects in Egypt to demonstrate the functionality. It was validated by comparing SEOUL's results to those received from current practice through three actual projects. The results obtained shows a 44\% and 33\% savings in initial cost and water consumption respectively when using SEOUL versus traditional landscape design tools.

  abstract = {Medium and large construction projects typically involve multiple structural consultants who use a wide range of structural analysis applications. These applications and technologies have inadequate interoperability and there is still a dearth of investigations addressing interoperability issues in the structural engineering domain. This paper proposes a novel approach which combines an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based Unified Information Model with a number of algorithms to enhance the interoperability: (a) between architectural and structural models, and (b) among multiple structural analysis models (bidirectional conversion or round tripping). The proposed approach aims to achieve the conversion by overcoming the inconsistencies in data structures, representation logics and syntax used in different software applications. The approach was implemented in both Client Server (C/S) and Browser Server (B/S) environments to enable central and remote collaboration among geographically dispersed users. The platforms were tested in four large real-life projects. The testing involved four key scenarios: (a) the bidirectional conversion among four structural analysis tools; (b) the comparison of the conversion via the proposed approach with the conversion via direct links among the involved tools; (c) the direct export from an IFC-based architectural tool through the Application Program Interface (API), and (d) the conversion and visualization of structural analysis results. All these scenarios were successfully performed and tested in four significant case studies. In particular, the conversion among the four structural analysis applications (ETABS, SAP2000, ANSYS and MIDAS) was successfully tested for all possible conversion routes among the four applications in two of the case studies (i.e., Project A and Project B). The first four steps of natural mode shapes and their natural vibration periods were calculated and compared with the converted models. They were all achieved within a standard deviation of 0.1s and 0.2s in Project A and Project B, respectively, indicating an accurate conversion.},

  abstract = {Buildings tend to not operate as intended, and a pronounced gap often exists between measured and predicted environmental and energy performance. Although the causes of this `performance gap' are multi-faceted, issues surrounding data integration are key contributory factors. The distributed nature of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry presents many challenges to the effective capture, integration and assessment of building performance data. Not all building data can be described semantically, nor is it feasible to create adapters between many different software tools. Similarly, not all building contextual data can easily be captured in a single product-centric model. This paper presents a new solution to the problem based upon a hybrid architecture that links data which is retained in its original format. The architecture links existing and efficient relational databases storing time-series data and semantically-described building contextual data. The main contribution of this work is an original RDF syntax structure and ontology to represent existing database schema information, and a new mechanism that automatically prepares data streams for processing by rule-based performance definitions. Two test cases evaluate the concept by 1) applying the hybrid architecture to building performance data from an actual building, and 2) evaluating the efficiency of the architecture against a purely RDF-based solution that also stores all of the time-series data in RDF for a virtual building. The hybrid architecture also avoids the duplication of time-series data and overcomes some of the differences found in database schemas and database platforms.},

Aiming to better characterize, evaluate and bridge these gaps, the paper proposes an online building energy performance monitoring and evaluation tool ObepME, serving as a basis for fault detection and diagnostics and forming a backbone for continuous commissioning. A calibrated building dynamic energy model is developed and employed to automatically run on a daily basis and simulate the building transient performance for the previous day. The simulated energy consumption results form a baseline to which the actual collected data are compared to evaluate the dynamic energy performance gap. The OU44 University building in Denmark is considered as a case study to implement the proposed framework. A holistic energy model was developed in EnergyPlus and calibrated employing data from various building meters, collected weather conditions, generated occupancy schedules and systems operational parameters and set-points. The calibrated model was employed in the ObepME tool to automatically and continuously monitor and evaluate the OU44 building energy performance, on the level of the whole building and individual energy systems consumption, throughout the period from February to mid-March 2017. The reported dynamic energy performance gap was around -2.85\%, -3.47\% and 5.48\% for heating, total electricity and ventilation system electricity consumption. In addition, specific observations were made on a daily basis in terms of the overall electricity, heating, lighting and ventilation energy consumption as highlighted by the ObepME tool. The ObepME tool is currently running automatically as a part of the OU44 building continuous commissioning and performance evaluation aiming to identify possible discrepancies and deviations paving the way for a methodical preventive fault detection and diagnostics process on various levels in the building.},

While fine-grained data may be available in some computer tools, the process for obtaining these data is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires software-related skills.

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) initially emerged as a capability to transfer information and allow interaction or interoperability of various software tools used for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical design, and building construction. Its application from developing 3D models, structural analysis, cost estimation, and mechanical analysis has now expanded to other applications such as energy simulation. Multiple computer-aided design (CAD) tools work as BIM authoring tools to generate BIM files in different formats containing various types of building information. In addition, there are various building energy modeling (BEM) tools capable of importing these BIM files to perform energy simulation. However, such tools have various capabilities and limitations and need to be investigated and categorized in order to facilitate choosing a proper tool for design professionals in different phases of project and purposes. In addition, interoperability and data exchange issues between BIM and BEM tools should be understood in order to find solutions such as developing proper corrective middleware tools to rectify them. This paper reviews the challenges, issues, and shortcomings in BIM-to-BEM interoperability process (BBIP) by proposing a detailed classification for these issues and studying the available solutions. The paper also explains how a corrective middleware, which is developed by the authors using Python, can be utilized to modify a gbXML file prior to adoption in energy simulation to resolve the issues related to building envelope in BBIP. To do so, initially a review is presented on research studies focused on different types of BIM schemas such as IFC and gbXML and energy simulation tools capable of reading these files such as Green Building Studio (GBS), DesignBuilder, Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES), and OpenStudio. In addition, some of the challenges in the application of BIM for energy simulation such as interoperability issues, lack of standards, and lack of easy solutions for extending existing BIM schemas and available corresponding solutions are also reviewed. With the focus on building envelope in mind, three case studies are discussed to observe the challenges and issues with respect to BBIP using Revit, GBS, and OpenStudio. Moreover, these case studies provide an opportunity to investigate the application of corrective middleware tools similar to what is developed in the study presented.},

  abstract = {The process of building design is a means of meeting client expectations for a building, followed by a set of comprehensive standards and codes relating to the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings. The rapidly rising volume of data along with increasing client expectations inspired many researchers to develop new computerized techniques to automate building design process. These techniques can be broken down into two broad categories: automated computer-aided design tools (e.g., development of building information modeling or BIM) and measuring or modeling client expectations (e.g., use of facial expressions to find psychological expectations of the client). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made possible new approaches to the automation of design. This represents a shift from a focus on client-designer or designer-technology relationships to a more intelligent and independent client-technology communication. In this paper, a novel AI system called intelligent designer is proposed to understand (or learn) the client's need and expectations and generate valid designs. The design environment (i.e., the interaction between the client and the design) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a mathematical framework is provided for making design decisions in situations where new designs are partly random (as they are influenced by the client's feedback) and partly under the control of the computer (as they are influenced by the regulations, standards, and guidelines). The approach is demonstrated using a window design experiment.},

  abstract = {Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable green design features into new/existing buildings has become a top priority in recent years for building owners, designers, contractors, and facility managers. This paper intends to address why delivery of an energy efficient building is not just the result of applying one or more isolated technologies. Rather, it can best be obtained using an integrated whole building process throughout the entire project development process, which leads building designers to generate a large amount of data during energy simulations. The authors observed that even a simple energy modeling run generated pages of data with many different variables. The volumes of energy modeling data clearly overwhelm traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with so many factors to be considered. An integrated or whole building design process involves studies of the energy-related impacts and interactions of all building components, including the building location, envelope (walls, windows, doors, and roof), heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, controls, and equipment, which shows why it is so difficult to find the correlation between different systems. The objective of this research is to develop an energy efficient building design process using data mining technology which can help project teams discover important patterns to improve the building design. This paper utilizes the data mining technology to extract interrelationships and patterns of interest from a large dataset. Case study revealed that data mining based energy modeling help project teams discover useful patterns to improve the energy efficiency of building design during the design phase. The method developed during this research could be used to guide designers and engineers through the process of completing an early design energy analysis based on energy simulation models.},

The contribution of this methodology is to extend the formal model transformation framework toward building energy system modeling, thus enabling efficient and flexible system synthesis through model decomposition and recomposition. It builds on SysML metamodeling and Triple Grammar Graph based model transformation that takes in the descriptive architecture model and outputs the corresponding TRNSYS model in a standardized fashion, thus greatly reducing the potential of heuristic modeling uncertainty. The automation is also extended to the analysis of the synthesized system; thereby human intervention becomes minimized, which expedites decision-makings at various steps of the model-based design exploration. The automation is applied to a special design problem of Model-based Predictive Controls that may contain the heuristic modeling uncertainty in case of custom modeling, and that also requires very frequent system analyses during development. Illustrative examples demonstrate modeling reliability, as well as enhanced modeling and analysis productivity, compared to the manual process. The enhanced productivity even allows extra explorations. If a designer were to create a TRNSYS model by hand, it would most likely be economically feasible to carry out only a few types and rounds of analyses for only a few system configurations at best. With the automated TRNSYS model generation and system analysis, designers can efficiently perform a much larger number of detailed analyses, which would result in an improved exploration of both the design space and the selected alternatives.},

This paper presents the development of a Modelica library for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based building energy simulation (ModelicaBIM library) using an Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) approach and Modelica, an equation-based OOPM language. By using the ModelicaBIM library, our project investigates system interfaces between BIM and energy simulation, which can perform semi-automatic translation from the building models in BIM to building energy modeling (BEM) using a BIM's authoring tool's Application Programming Interface (API). The ModelicaBIM library consists of OOPM-based BIM classes and OOPM-based BIM structure. OOPM-based BIM classes represent building component information. OOPM-based BIM structure consists of test case models that demonstrate (i) how building information in BIM can be transformed to OOPM and (ii) how design operations in BIM, such as changing a building geometry and editing building components, can be translated into BEM. A case study for simulation result comparisons has been conducted using (i) OOPM-based BIM models in the ModelicaBIM library and (ii) LBNL Modelica Buildings library (a Modelica-based building thermal simulation library developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Our implementation shows that the ModelicaBIM library enables (i) objects in BIM to be translated into the OOPM-based energy models and (ii) existing OOPM library to be utilized as a simulation solver for BIM-based energy simulation.},

The variables comprise geometry, envelope, fixtures, as well as the heating energy source. The objective is the life cycle environmental impact expressed in terms of the six most common LCA indicators. The results show that a relatively compact shape, large windows to south equipped with shading and very high levels of insulation are optimal from an environmental perspective. It was also proven that focusing only on the embodied or operational impact leads to a suboptimal solution, and the choice of the energy source for the operation of the building has a significant influence on the achievable optimum. Through the optimization, significant environmental savings of 60\textendash 80\% were achieved compared to the initial design options showing the potential for the application of such methods in architectural design.},

However, only limited details are provided in the literature to proceed with such calibration approach. In this paper, an off line automated calibration approach of EnergyPlus HVAC sub-system models was proposed and tested. The proposed approach consisted of reducing the number of parameters to be adjusted using sensitivity analysis and meta-heuristic optimization for sequential calibrations of HVAC sub-system components. The proposed calibration approach used available trend data and can be adapted to different equipment configurations. The proposed calibration approach was then used in a trial application on a real HVAC system. The results of the trial application showed that a calibrated fan power demand under the ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014 was obtained using the calculated airflow rate from fan laws and the measured mixed and supply air temperatures. The proposed approach provided an interesting perspective for the calibration of highly detailed building energy model (BEM) and went hand in hand with the integration of BEM tools into the operation phase of the building life.},

  abstract = {In pursuit of including energy performance as feedback for architects' early stage design decision making, this research presents the theoretical foundation of a designer oriented multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework titled evolutionary energy performance feedback for design (EEPFD). Through a comprehensive literature review and gap analysis EEPFD is developed into an MDO methodology that provides energy performance as feedback for influencing architects' decision making more fluidly and earlier than other approaches to date. Secondly, in response to the lack of an MDO best practice EEPFD is investigated and evaluated through two experiments. The first experiment demonstrates the ability to utilize EEPFD provided energy performance as feedback to pursue multiple architectural designs with competing objectives and tradeoffs. The second experiment identifies performance boundaries as a best practice for MDO applications to the early stage architectural design processes. The research synthesizes the results into the basis for measuring these performance boundaries as a best practice in the context where architects must gauge multiple design concepts with varying complexity coupled with performance objectives through EEPFD, thereby enhancing the influence of energy performance feedback on the early stage design process. Finally, future research into the use of performance boundaries for conceptual energy performance design exploration is discussed.},

  abstract = {Current European legislation calls for the abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through better building design and technological solutions, in order to reduce operational energy use, embodied energy and embodied material emissions originating from buildings. Presently, environmental performance assessment tools for buildings fall short of documenting all of these parameters. Comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) may be used to obtain a clear overview of mass and energy flows in a building. However, construction professional consider LCA calculations as complex and time consuming. Therefore, this paper outlines a methodology for the development of a dynamic parametric analysis tool (PAT) for the comprehensive assessment of operational energy use, embodied energy and embodied material emissions during the production and operation phases of a building. A simple, conceptual building case study is presented to demonstrate the potential use of this parametric analysis tool. The results show that the PAT developed in this study can be used to define optimal solutions of building envelopes for the different parameters of the analysis. In conclusion, this study facilitates the first steps of development and testing for a PAT that evaluate optimised solutions that minimise operational energy use, embodied CO2eq emissions and embodied energy. The tool, which is not meant to give precise results, given its limitations in the calculation method, can be used for performing a comparative pre-assessment of various design solutions. This body of work highlights considerable scope of work for the further development of this tool.},

  abstract = {Building engineers need access to real-time data to make retrofit decisions or improve the energy performance of the building occupants. Such data is typically gathered with the help of fixed wired and/or wireless sensors. Such a process consumes a significant amount of time, effort, and financial resources, particularly in existing buildings which do not have a Building Automation Systems (BAS) installed. This paper introduces a framework that uses autonomous mobile indoor robots for gathering actionable building information in real-time, and discusses how this information can be further utilized for various analyses and critical decision-making. The navigation and drift correction algorithms developed for autonomous robot operation are described in detail. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method in large areas using only a sparse set of sensors mounted on mobile indoor robots. This research also developed a generic framework for making informed retrofit decisions with the help of robot collected data. A case study is performed to demonstrate the informed retrofit decision making process with the help of temperature data collected by a robot and subsequently used in an EnergyPlus simulation. Simulated annual energy savings of 3\% were obtained by slightly modifying the R-values (20\% to 45\% improvement) of one of the external wall assemblies. These savings are expected to be larger if whole building retrofit and upgrade of material is performed. Thus, the proposed framework offers promise in improving the energy efficiency by extending the approach to other combinations of building materials (e.g. doors and windows).},

This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time. On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development.

  abstract = {This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS `intelligence' is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates `suggestions' which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken.},

  abstract = {Industrial manufacturing is the largest end-use sector in terms of both final energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions (more than 30\% of the total); its increase is rapidly altering the world climate. The need to mitigate the environmental impacts of manufacturing processes makes energy efficiency a key success factor for sustainable production. Accordingly, the scientific community's interest in energy management has grown considerably, resulting in several literature reviews on energy modelling and production systems analysis, emissions calculation, sustainability tools and benchmarking techniques. However, a comprehensive analysis of methods and tools aimed at improving energy awareness and assessing their effects on energy efficiency is lacking. To address this gap, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review of energy assessment methods and tools. From the 1367 papers retrieved by searching scientific literature databases, 64 scientific articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed in detail. The study aims to provide scholars with a picture of the current state of scientific research and to identify the scientific works that could help industry practitioners in energy management. Following the ISO 50001 framework, the methods and tools were divided into three main groups (i.e. energy analysis, energy evaluation and energy-saving measures methods) and the specific findings relating to each group were synthesized. Finally, the paper addresses unresolved issues and challenges and makes suggestions for future research directions.},

The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

In most cases, rules of thumb are applied and experienced guesses are made; simulation software is used only to validate the assumptions, which do not necessarily lead to the intended optimum.

However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages.},

  abstract = {Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has gained large popularity in recent years. However, its effective design remains challenging. Different but often related design concerns regarding BIPV are normally treated, in the current practice, in multiple but separated design phases with different models and tools. The complexities in maintaining the consistency between those models employed in separated phases make seamless PV and building integration, one of the major concerns of BIPV design, far from satisfying. To this end, this paper proposes a uniform BIPV design platform: e-BIM, which is a BIM (Building Information Modelling) - centric BIPV design and analysis software platform, to address the related design concerns via one uniform data model. The concept of domain-specific models is introduced to allow the external PV-related models to be integrated into the uniform model. To simplify model synchronization problem, the domain-specific views corresponding to specific domains are provided to designers and meanwhile a synchronization engine is developed to automate data consistency among views and the uniform model. The current prototype is developed based on Autodesk\textregistered{} Revit and tested in a practical BIPV application. The results show that this platform achieves seamless BIPV design for architects, PV system designers and electricity professionals. Moreover, compared to the initial BIPV design, the photovoltaic system cost is reduced by 11.7\% and the transmission losses by 2.95\%.},

Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data from the operations phase of another school delivered previously.

  abstract = {Building energy models (BEMs) are typically used for design and code compliance for new buildings and in the renovation of existing buildings to predict energy use. The increasing adoption of BEM as standard practice in the building industry presents an opportunity to extend the use of BEMs into construction, commissioning and operation. In 2009, the authors developed a real-time simulation framework to execute an EnergyPlus model in real time to improve building operation. This paper reports an enhancement of that real-time energy simulation framework. The previous version only works with software tools that implement the custom co-simulation interface of the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB), such as EnergyPlus, Dymola and TRNSYS. The new version uses an open standard interface, the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI), to provide a generic interface to any application that supports the FMI protocol. In addition, the new version utilizes the Simple Measurement and Actuation Profile (sMAP) tool as the data acquisition system to acquire, store and present data. This paper introduces the updated architecture of the real-time simulation framework using FMI and presents proof-of-concept demonstration results which validate the new framework.},

  abstract = {Utility design assistance programs face cost-effectiveness challenges due to rising code minimums and the increased costs of the advanced energy analysis needed to design beyondcode buildings. Because of this pressure, managers of these programs are looking for ways to lower the cost of energy analysis and increase the performance of the buildings being designed. The energy consultants that perform this analysis typically use a workflow in which they define a baseline energy model, run a number of alternative design scenarios, and use the results to recommend a particular set of energy conservation measures (ECMs) for a project. Such a workflow is possible using the first version of the OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT), which additionally leverages the flexibility of OpenStudio Measures and the Building Component Library (BCL) to enable user-customizable, sharable parametric descriptions of ECMs. PAT is a flexible, freely available tool, which can be used for many types of building energy simulation projects. In this paper we will focus on the use of PAT as part of the Xcel Energy Design Assistance Program and explain the particular features that were built-in to support that use case, including utility-approved measures and energy model input data, utilityspecific Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QAQC) checks, automated reporting, and access to cloud computing. Xcel has found that using PAT helps its EDA program remain viable by making energy modeling cheaper while finding equal or deeper savings without sacrificing quality.},

  abstract = {Recent research on identification of user barriers for the adoption of building performance simulation (BPS) tools indicates that architects wants to use the output from BPS to inform their decisions in the early design stage, but only if the BPS tools are conformed to fit their design practice. In this paper we therefore propose a research framework for the development of BPS tools conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage. The proposed framework was constructed based on review of existing research methodologies in the area of BPS for informing decisions in the early design stage, and on review of methodologies used in other research fields, such as design research, social science, software development, and innovation research. The proposed research framework consists of four elements: 1) a reflective researcher who navigates the research activities and reflect on research methods, approaches and outcome; 2) a framing of the research to identify relevant theme, topic and research question of interest; 3) an iterative workflow procedure of planning, acting, observing and reflecting to generate a spiral of understanding, inspired by action research; and 4) a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods and approaches from the related research fields that could be applied continuously to seek and refine different solutions. The paper also reports on an application example which demonstrated that the framework is a helpful tool for systematic navigation and documentation of research activities and collection of data. Furthermore, the iterative nature of the framework continuously increases the researchers understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the design practice in early design stage enabling them to make better proposals for BPS tools that are conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage.},

Thus, the final model is based solely on evidence. Version control software stores a complete record of the calibration process, and the evidence on which the final model is based. Future users can review the changes made throughout the calibration process along with the supporting evidence. In addition to the evidence-based methodology, this paper also describes a new zoning process that represents the real building more closely than the typical core and four perimeter zone approach. Though the methodology is intended to apply to detailed calibration studies with high resolution measured data, the primary aspects of the methodology (evidence-based approach, version control, and zone-typing) are independent of the available measured data.},

  abstract = {Simulations of building energy use can give insights into how energy efficiency retrofits and operational changes can influence a building's total and temporal energy use. However, before those models are used to generate recommendations, it is important to understand how accurately the simulations predict actual energy use. This paper seeks to determine model accuracy by considering 54 homes in Austin, TX that are part of a smart grid demonstration project. Data about the homes were collected with energy audits then converted into energy models using BEopt (version 2.0), a residential building-focused graphical user interface (GUI) front-end for EnergyPlus developed by NREL. Actual meter reads (kWh) were compared to simulation results for four cases: (1) energy model output with typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data, (2) output with an actual meteorological year weather (AMY) file created using real weather data from a year during which actual energy use measurements were made, (3) model output with thermostat user behavior data, and (4) output using a simplified home geometry. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate how well this model, as it is, could be expected to predict energy usage using varying levels of inputs that might be included on an energy audit and survey. Results indicate that the modeling software was able to estimate aggregate annual electrical energy usage within 1\% (for groups of homes) but might vary up to 28\% (absolute) for an individual home. Using AMY weather data (Case 2) yielded results within 2.4\% of measured (aggregate) energy use, while using a TMY3 weather file for Austin yielded results within 9\% of (aggregate) actual usage. Using a simplified home geometry did not appreciably change the results of the model or its ability to simulate real usage. Results show that while the model does a reasonable job predicting usage for homes with average usage, the model has trouble predicting usage of homes with low or high consumption, particularly homes below 5kWh/ft2/year (0.47kWh/m2/year) of average energy use or above 10kWh/ft2/year (0.93kWh/m2/year), likely due to unknowns about the home when BEopt defaults were used.},

Modelkit is an embedded Ruby library that allows modelers to create parameterized templates that instantiate different specific EnergyPlus input files depending on parameter values. OpenStudio Measures provide programmatic access to the OpenStudio object model; that model is translated into an EnergyPlus input file. CBECC uses a custom scripting/rule engine that operates on the Standards Data Dictionary (SDD) building model schema; OpenStudio is used to translate SDD files to EnergyPlus input files. The paper discusses the philosophy behind each system, its architecture and core capabilities, and uses simple modeling tasks to show how each system is used in practice.},

Rhino/Grasshopper is one of the most widely used platforms that are used by designers today. There are already a number of environmental plugins developed for Rhino/Grasshopper. However, Ladybug offers several advantages that are currently not offered by existing Rhino/Grasshopper related environmental design plugins.
Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. It also simplifies the process of analysis, automates and expedites the calculations, and provides easy to understand graphical visualizations in the 3D modeling interface of Rhino/Grasshopper. It also allows users to work with validated energy and daylighting engines such as EnergyPlus, Radiance and Daysim. Integration with the parametric tools of grasshopper allows for almost instantaneous feedback on design modifications, and as it runs within the design environment, the information and analysis is interactive. The development is a free and open source; users can customize the tool based on their needs and contribute to the source code.},

Therefore, this paper is to investigate the development process of ASF grounded on parametric design tools with a focus towards its visual comfort indices through a controllable shading system. To that end, first, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to develop an origami-based dynamic system, and three numerical timing patterns were then applied using Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino. In addition, the environmental plug-ins of Honeybee and Ladybug were employed to determine indoor daylight quality via different geometrical and physical properties. Thus, 1800 design models were prepared, based on several variables including rotation motions, indoor view angles, time hours and transmittance properties in order to investigate the daylighting performance and glare probability in a single office space located in the hot-arid climate representative; Tehran, Iran. Furthermore, interactive correlations between the geometrical pattern and visual performance were investigated, leading to this fact that the proposed prototype can significantly improve the flexibility of the shading system to control visual comfort. As the conclusion, all datasets were integrated into an algorithmic workflow while converting its advantages and limitations into an optimization process. Finally, a full potential hexagonal adaptive system was presented to achieve the maximum visual comfort level based on the users' preferences that can be the basis for future investment on smart building envelopes.},

  abstract = {Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.
Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include
Java,
C++,
C\#,
Python,

The current emphasis on the interpretation of building energy performance means that the enhancement of energy analysis tools and their ease of use is worthy of study. Based on analyses of building energy and the physical properties of materials, material properties essential to the analysis of building energy performance were selected. These properties were automatically extracted and stored using an algorithm to collect information from the internet. Based on the designed algorithms, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey and qualitative analysis to measure their convenience. From the analysis, the satisfaction level was found to exceed an average of 80\%, resulting in a high level of satisfaction for practitioners using the energy analysis tool. It was also shown that the perceived convenience could be improved by reducing the duration of the search by at least 60\% and by applying physical property information to the energy analysis application.},

  abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is instrumental in documenting design, enhancing customer experience, and improving product functionality in capital projects. However, high-quality building models do not happen by accident, but rather because of a managed process that involves several participants from different disciplines and backgrounds. Throughout this process, the different priorities of design modelers often result in conflicts that can negatively impact project outcomes. To prevent such unwanted outcomes from occurring, the modeling process needs to be effectively managed. This effective management requires an ability to closely monitor the modeling process and correctly measure the modelers' performance. Nevertheless, existing methods of performance monitoring in building design practices lack an objective measurement system to quantify modeling progress. The widespread utilization of BIM tools presents a unique opportunity to retrieve granular design process data and conduct accurate performance measurements. This research improves upon previous efforts by presenting a novel application programming interface (API)-enabled approach to (a) automatically collect detailed model development data directly from BIM software packages in real-time, and (b) efficiently calculate several modeling performance measures during schematic and design development phases of building projects. These indicators can be used to properly arrange modeling teams in the quest for high-quality building models. The specific objectives of this study to examine the feasibility of a proposed automated design performance measurement framework, and to identify optimal modeling team configurations using empirical performance information. A passive data recording approach allows for the real-time capture of comprehensive user interface (UI) interaction and model element modification events. The proposed framework is implemented as an Autodesk Revit plugin. Next, an experiment is conducted to capture data using the developed Revit plugin. Experiment participants' individual production rates are estimated to establish the validity of the proposed approach to identify the optimal design team configuration. The presented approach uses the earliest due date (EDD) sequencing rule in combination with the critical path method (CPM) to calculate the maximum lateness for different design team arrangements.},

Modeler was developed as a tool that integrates various formats of the planning data into a unified format during the planning stage. It automates the three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the integrated urban space and presents visual information to support decision-making processes. The system architecture of Modeler includes the formation of building polygons, textures for classified land cover shape, topography, and 3D urban space. Modeler was developed on a native-based software (S/W) platform. It was created with a single document frame (SDF) from the Windows Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library and is driven by a 3D-based engine that can be used by a GIS client. Modeler was validated for a domestic city in the urban planning stage on a test bed platform. Because of the expansion of a ubiquitous environment and increasing social network services (SNS), the ability to port the Modeler to a web-based platform should be investigated, thus enabling easier access for decision makers.},

Based on the simulation data on energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort, the study also used a simulation-based improved back-propagation (BP) network which is optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to characterize building behavior, and then establishes a GA\textendash BP network model for rapidly predicting the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort status of residential buildings; Third, the building design multi-objective optimization model was established by using the GA\textendash BP network as a fitness function of the multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II); Finally, a case study is presented with the aid of the multi-objective approach in which dozens of potential designs are revealed for a typical building design in China, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption.},

The development of an open-source research tool, jEPlus, has been reported in 2009. The tool is designed to assist setting up parametric runs with EnergyPlus models, and to perform the simulations in ``parallel'' mode. This paper uses an example to demonstrate how jEPlus can be used for setting up complex parametric runs. In the example, four different building types and five HVAC system configurations were considered along with design parameters including insulation, glazing, temperature set points and day lighting control options. Further more, the simulations were carried out in three different climatic regions. Given that the total number of simulations exceeds 30,000, it would have been a tedious, if not impossible, job to set them up manually. jEPlus made it trivial, however, by automating the tasks such as generating input files for EnergyPlus, executing simulations, and extracting results.},

The proposed algorithm aims to support fully-automated energy compliance checking in the construction domain by allowing automated extraction of the requirements from the codes instead of the status quo which relies on manual extraction of requirements from codes and manual formalization of those requirements in a computer-processable format. Automated information extraction from energy conservation codes, compared to other building codes, is a far complex task because many code provisions are long, hierarchically-complex, and with exceptions. A combination of text classification methods, domain-specific preprocessing techniques, ontology-based pattern-matching extraction techniques, sequential dependency-based extraction methods, and cascaded extraction methods is proposed to deal with such complexity in extraction. The proposed algorithm was tested in extracting energy requirements from Chapter 4 of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code, and the results showed 97.4\% recall and 98.5\% precision.},
